<h3>who am i? :0</h3>
<p>I'm fGrey, a silly little amateur coder and audio creature who still has yet to put anything here :D</p>
<h3>what am i doing here? ',:|</h3>
Honestly, no idea. May or may not put some of my future projects here, but at the moment i'm nowhere near disciplined enough to come even remotely close to starting nor finishing any real semi-large projects, even though i am thoroughly enjoying myself :)
<h3>more about meee:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I like the funky words in the code editor that make my computer do stuff</li>
	<li>I want to one day make VST plugins for digital audio workstations and various other sound related projects</li>
	<li>My IQ is smaller than my shoe size, so i don't know how to make VST plugins for digital audio workstations and various other sound related projects YET</li>
</ul>
