<h3>what am i doing here?</h3>
Honestly, no idea. Might put some of my future projects here, but at the moment i'm nowhere near disciplined enough to come even remotely close to finishing any real semi-large projects haha

<h3>about me</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I mostly use C/C++</li>
	<li>I want to one day make VST plugins for digital audio workstations</li>
	<li>My IQ is smaller than my shoe size, so i don't know how to make VST plugins for digital audio workstations YET</li>
</ul>

<em>Can't come up with more relevant stuff to put here right now so that's about it for me :)<em>
