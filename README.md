<h1>HEYO!!1!</h1>
<p>I'm fGrey, a silly little amateur hobby coder who still has yet to upload anything here :D</p>
<h3>what am i doing here?</h3>
Honestly, no idea. May or may not put some of my future projects here, but at the moment i'm nowhere near disciplined enough to come even remotely close to starting nor finishing any real semi-large projects haha
<h3>about me</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I mostly use C/C++</li>
	<li>I want to one day make VST plugins for digital audio workstations</li>
	<li>My IQ is smaller than my shoe size, so i don't know how to make VST plugins for digital audio workstations YET</li>
</ul>
<em>Can't come up with more relevant stuff to put here right now so i think that'd be about it for now ;3c</em>
